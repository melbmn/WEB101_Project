## Challenges and Lessons Learned
* I faced a steep learning curve with the logic and syntax behind coding my first project.
    * I set aside time outside of class to research questions I had and utilized the resources the CodePath community provided. I also seeked out "next steps" to continue that challenge and growth process.
* I restarted the project three times before I was satisfied with the consistency and visual display.
    * I learned that planning in advance is essential before starting a project and I should define my goals, target audience, site structure, and aesthetic.
* I struggled to balance time dedicated to this project to implement the stretch features. 
    * I developed time management skills and learned prioritizing my tasks accordingly to meet my goals.
